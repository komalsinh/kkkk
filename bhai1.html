	<ol>
		<li> We came into the world like brother and sister; And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.</li>
		<li>Because brothers don’t let each other wander in the dark alone.</li>
		<li>When brothers agree, no fortress is so strong as their common life.</li>
		<li>After a girl is grown, her little brothers, now her protectors; seem like big brothers.</li>
		<li>He who understands you is greater kin to you than your own brother. For even your own kindred neither understand you nor know your true worth.</li>
		<li> My brother is one of my true heroes. Steady and sober where I am impulsive and emotional.</li>
		<li>Nothing can stop me from loving my brother.</li>
		<li> There is no success you can celebrate more than the success of a brother. </li>
